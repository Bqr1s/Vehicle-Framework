&lt;title&gt;Bug Fixes&lt;/title&gt;&lt;font&gt;Tiny&lt;/font&gt;
- Graphic Overlays with patterns not rendering properly for blueprint placement.

- Raiders still attacking vehicles with no pawns inside if turret was set to auto-target

- Vehicles not deregistering from cover grid when rotating.

- Vehicles could spawn out of bounds at certain angles when arriving with vanilla-chosen spawn position.

- Mods using vanilla targeter such as 'Rimworld of Magic' and 'Eccentric Extras - Flares' would prevent vehicle targeters from starting. This included aerial launch targeting.

- Vehicles entering maps would not take road areas into account.

- Upgrades could be transfered to other vehicles by selecting another vehicle in the menu right before confirming the upgrade.

- Vehicles spawning into a map would reset their target fuel level.

- Pawns would not board a vehicle unless standing within distance to instant-board.
&lt;title&gt;Performance Optimization&lt;/title&gt;&lt;font&gt;Tiny&lt;/font&gt;
- Targeters don't run unless activated.

- Vehicle regions will build in the background, significantly reducing impact to map generation times.
&lt;title&gt;Additional Changes&lt;/title&gt;&lt;font&gt;Tiny&lt;/font&gt;
- Vehicles can be temporarily disabled by EMPs.

- Vehicles can be 'stashed' on the world map, allowing your colonists to continue on foot and retrieve your vehicles at a later time.
&lt;b&gt;Players&lt;/b&gt;
- Vehicles consume 50% less fuel while idle

- Added more entries to vehicle info cards including build costs, total health, turrets, etc.

- Added 'teleport' DevMode button to vehicles when godmode is enabled, moving the vehicle instantly to a targeted location.
&lt;b&gt;Modders&lt;/b&gt;
- Added affectedByEMP bool to vehicle properties.

- FireMode shotsPerBurst and ticksBetweenBursts are now IntRange, allowing for varied burst counts and varied timing between bursts to make machine gun fire less robotic.
&lt;title&gt;Final Notes&lt;/title&gt;&lt;font&gt;Tiny&lt;/font&gt;
